            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <span>Loved the idea so far? Lets look at some cool things this library can do!</span>

        </div>

        <div id = "featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 1: Individual Cards</h4>
            <span>You can have individual cards on its own. Depending on the purpose, you can choose to include the picture or not.</span>
            <div id ="f1container">
                <div id='myId1'></div>
                <div id='myId5'></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 2: Flip</h4>
            <span>If you click anywhere on the card, the card will flip to show its different view! <br> Woah! isn't that smooth?</span>
            <div id ="f1container">
                <div id='clickMe'></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 3: Backview</h4>
            <span> Once flipped, you can see the backview! Here you can have detailed information about the cards.</span>
            <div id ="f1container">
                <div id='quizcard'></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 4: About and Link Section</h4>
            <span> Once flipped, you can switch between About and Link section where About contains inforamtion about the card, and Link will have any addtional links related to the card!</span>
            <br><br>
            <span> <b>Cool Fact:</b> As an additional feature, when you click on the links or switch between about and link, it prevents the default behaviour of flipping! <br> What else? You don't need to worry about DOM, as it elegantly swithces without affecting other elements on your page!</span>

            <div id ="f1container">
                <div id='myId4'></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 5: Multiple Cards</h4>
            <span> You can have multiple cards in a big container. The DOM is adjusted automatically!</span>
            <div id ="f1container">
                <div id='myId2'></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="featuretype1">
            <h4 class="featureHeading"> Feature 6: Expand and Collapse</h4>
            <span> If you feel you page is full of cards, you can collapse the cards in a small container and expand them whenever you want by clicking anywhere on the container!
            <br>
            <b>Won't that mess my web page?</b> Actually NO, the awesome thing about this library is, DOM is effeciently manipulated!
            <br>
            <b>What else?</b> Oh! in case you missed it, a collapse button was added so can can collapse the big container back!

                <div id='myId3'></div>

            <p> I tried to cover many use cases through my examples above! However there are many more use cases for the library like Photo walls, Navigation Window, Games! Actually, this library can be used almost anywhere!</p>

            <p>I demostrated just some of the features here! There are <b>many more features</b> like adding links, changing colours of containers, changing colours of different cards in the same container, etc!</p> To explore more, visit the <b>API Documentation</b> in the NavBar to see what's in store for you! I hope you enjoyed the library and are excited to gets hands on with it!
